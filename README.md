## A repository to record and store all my learning notes and practice-code of Angular 2.0/4.0.
# Files Information

* All Notes: /Notes

**Note:** 
All Notes are in Apple Pages(.pages) and PDF(.pdf) formats.

# Where to Look

For practice code information, extra Angular code tweaks and other code examples which I found during learning period will be in this note also as "Overall Notes".

**"Notes/0 - 01 Extra Notes.pdf":**  
For further roadmaps with Angular.
Like Front-end design frameworks like Bootstrap, Material Design, etc.

Look at **"Notes/0 - 00 Practice-Code Notes.pdf"** for more info.
